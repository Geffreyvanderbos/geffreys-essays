## House hunting
We've been viewing some houses in Arnhem.
Placing some bids, never winning any. Slightly frustrating but that's the current market.
There are some exciting changes on the horizon.
I'm getting more responsibilities at work and with that a slight salary increase.
Enough to get a larger mortage and a higher chance getting a place.

## Writing
I'm currently practicing my writing.
There are two topics I'd like to cover: **curiosity** and **mindfulness**.

## Thinking about
I'm thinking about how I could benefit a lot from the idea of Standard Operating Procedures. 
Not in an industrial sense but in life. 
Inspired by [The Checklist](https://archive.ph/ktPmc#selection-443.0-443.9) article by Atul Gawanda, Rob Hope's [Interactlist](https://interactlist.com/), and my experience with SOPs on a medical engineering job.

## Music
I've been obsessed with Shostakovich the past few weeks. 
Especially [his piano pieces](https://open.spotify.com/album/5LkCoye48DppJYnIpOurSf?si=k4at2Dr0QLGnYKVv7zO-fQ). 
Something about them tickles my fancy.
Dissonance, odd times, left field chord changes.
Excellent.
The [Frankfurt Radio Symphony their rendition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB3zR_X25UU) of his 7th symphony is outstanding, too.
