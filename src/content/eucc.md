I’m worried about the [EU ChatControl regulation](https://fightchatcontrol.eu/). With the vote scheduled at 14 October 2025,  it’s nearing a critical decision point. The regulation requires service providers to scan ALL communications on:
- Emails
- messaging apps (yes, even the encrypted ones)
- collaboration platforms (Slack, Teams, Discord, etc.)
- and cloud service (Google Drive, iCloud, etc.)

This to ‘detect illegal content like child sexual abuse material’. The idea is to use on-device scanning, before it gets encrypted (if at all). 
The risks posed by ChatControl go far beyond our superficial privacy concerns.

1. The regulation will create a backdoor on every device. This backdoor will become a high-value target for cyberattacks, increasing information leaks and unauthorized access.
2. I doubt that any automated system can reliably distinguish lawful from unlawful content. There will be mass false positives, anything suspicious will be reported. 
3. The risk that such surveillance tools are used for targeting journalists, whitleblowers, protestors, activists, and political opponents is HUGE. Do you trust the current and future political climate with such a weapon? 
4. This normalisation of surveillance will erode democratic freedoms. Giving away our sovereignty bit by bit. We’ll slowly realise we gave a future authoritarian regime a sophisticated censorship and monitoring infrastructure early.

I can also guarantee you this: as easy as we implement scanning algorithms, as easily criminals will find ways to bypass it.

This is not a sci-fi anymore. This is happening. Look around! Trump would LOVE a system like this. Putin is a step ahead with Max. Most Chinese people have given up already.

ChatControl is an utterly pointless idea by incompetent, short-sighted politicians. And the funniest part? They would be exempt from the surveillance!

This is what you can do:
- contact your government representatives demanding they reject or oppose the proposed law. 
- Raise awareness on social media is vital,
- as is signing petitions and sharing informational resources. 
- Personal actions such as calling your ministers and urging them to withdraw or oppose the legislation can have a significant impact.

Good luck to all of us.
