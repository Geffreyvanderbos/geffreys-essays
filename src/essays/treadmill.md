title: Why we are never satisfied

Humans have a tendency to adapt to positive or negative life changes. Always returning to their baseline happiness.

This tendency—what Brickman and Campbell (1971) call **hedonic adaptation**—explains why the joy of a new purchase, promotion, or achievement often fades surprisingly quickly.

As I write this, I have this nagging thought that “I should move closer to a city; that’ll make me happier.” Knowing full well that once I’ve moved, I’d be hunting down the next thing that *might make me happier*.

Although the hedonic treadmill alone gives us a rather pessimistic outlook, recent research updated the model with some positives:
1. most individuals have a positive rather than neutral baseline,
2. set points vary between individuals based on personality factors,
3. people have multiple happiness set points across different life domains,
4. adaptation rates differ between individuals, and
5. people can learn skills to sustainably enhance well-being.

The last point offers hope and begs the question: *what skills can I learn to overcome hedonic adaptation?*
### The sneaky power of our environment
First, before we start with modifying our own behavior, let’s look at our environment, which plays a huge role in hedonic adaptation.

In our modern world, we're surrounded by temptations, from perfectly placed snacks at the grocery store checkout to ads selling all kinds of products.

This "obesogenic environment," makes us susceptible to impulsive decisions. Because of the constant barrage of new temptations, we're continuously enticed into seeking that next “fleeting pleasure”. 

This creates that vicious cycle of adaptation.

We buy something, get a temporary happiness boost, adapt to it, and then our visible and convenient environment presents the next thing we think we need to feel good again.

The good news is, we can use this same principle to our advantage.

Think of it this way: instead of relying on willpower to resist that roll of Oreos, what if you simply moved it out of sight? Or better yet, what if you placed a bowl of [anything healthier] in its place? (I do this replacing the notorious ‘car winegums’ with raisins.)

This doesn’t only apply to food.

Leave your phone at home when you’re going to the park (😱). Use Instagram their dumbed-down web version on the phone. Put your coke in the garage instead of on the dinner table.  I don’t know. You do you.

This simple act of modifying your environment can significantly reduce the mental effort needed to make a better choice. The key here is to proactively change your surroundings so they don’t sabotage you from the get-go.

### Taming the treadmill

Our minds are wired to take things for granted. The new car that brought us so much joy becomes just "the car." The comfortable, hard-earned  home becomes just "home." This is the core of hedonic adaptation.

But we can fight back by consciously appreciating what we already have. This is where **mindfulness and gratitude** come in. And I hear you, “Ugh, this hippie shit again.” Yet, hear me out. Sure, the word "mindfulness" is a modern term, but the concept is ancient.

- Ancient Buddhism (c. 5th Century BCE): Sati (Pali), Smriti (Sanskrit) or  Sampajañña (Pali).
- Early Christianity and Medieval Europe: Contemplative Prayer and Apatheia (Stoicism and Early Christianity).
- 19th and Early 20th Century Philosophy: Pure Consciousness
- Late 20th Century (Post-1970s): Mindfulness.

It all comes down to ‘being in the moment’. Appreciating the current moment instead of craving for ‘future pleasure’ or past.

By practicing it, we train our minds (like a muscle) to notice the good things that are already here.

When you’re more mindful, you start to see that a lot of what you value is already in your life. This can reduce your impulsivity, making those future rewards—the "next thing" you're chasing—seem less valuable. So, next time you're enjoying something, try turning off your phone and really soaking it in (active listening to music is transformative, truly).

**Gratitude practices** take this a step further. Instead of just noticing, we're actively appreciating. Keeping a gratitude journal, for example, is a powerful way to shift your focus from what's missing to what's present.

You're not just writing a list; you’re systematically documenting the abundance in your life, whether it’s a good cup of coffee, a kind word from a colleague, or something adorable your dog did.

Studies show that these practices can lead to a lasting increase in happiness and a decrease in depressive symptoms. They help us break the cycle of constantly wanting more by showing us that we already have enough.

### The self-control secret: it's not about denying pleasure

You might think that to get off the hedonic treadmill, you need to become a pleasure-denying robot (‘[not a sexbot](https://youtube.com/shorts/qhgDciAzH0w?si=Yje6vev2Cu2d9RkC)’).

That is false.

Research suggests that people with higher self-control actually get *more* enjoyment from their favorite activities.

How? Because they're not indulging on a whim. They’re being strategic.

Instead of fighting temptations with sheer willpower—which often leads to burnout—they use **self-control and planning strategies**. For instance, they might plan their purchases ahead of time or turn off their phone during a leisure activity. 

This "proactive" approach is far more effective than trying to resist a craving in the moment.

You can get more skillful in this by becoming more aware of your emotions. When you feel a certain way—like boredom or sadness—that might trigger an impulsive decision (e.g. mastrubation–you know it), simply acknowledging that feeling can help you choose a different, more beneficial path.

So, instead of just numbing yourself with a mediocre series after a bad day, you could try planning a fun activity you know you'll genuinely enjoy. (Make a list of things you enjoy for occasions like this!)

You're not denying yourself pleasure; you're making a conscious choice to indulge in a way that feels more fulfilling and less like a quick fix.

### The power of shaking things up

Our brains love novelty. The new, the surprising, the unexpected—these things grab our attention and give us a hit of happiness. But when we do the same thing over and over, that feeling fades.

This is where a **variety and novelty approach** comes in.

To prevent hedonic adaptation from taking hold, we need to introduce change into our lives, especially when it comes to the things we do for fun. Think about it: a surprise vacation will probably make you happier than taking the same trip to the same place every year. The same goes for smaller things, like trying a new restaurant or a new hobby.

One easy way to do this is to **break up your consumption patterns**. Instead of going to the same coffee shop every morning (what a luxery!), try that new tea place on the corner.

Or if you always listen to the same music, switch it up! I ask LLMs for a list of obscure music genres and their representative bands. Or explore the numerous of sub-gernes on [Every Noise](https://everynoise.com/).

You can also try creating a rotation of enjoyable activities so you're not always doing the same thing. The goal is to keep things fresh, so the rewards don't diminish over time. This approach helps you get off that addictive cycle of needing more and more to feel good.

### Finding the sweet spot between pleasure and purpose

Ultimately, getting off the hedonic treadmill isn't about avoiding pleasure; it's about not making pleasure your only goal.

We need to find a balance between two types of well-being:
- Hedonic well-being—the pursuit of pleasure and positive emotions.
- Eudaimonic well-being—the pursuit of meaning and purpose.

An overemphasis on either one can be a problem. Chasing pleasure alone leads us right back to the treadmill. But focusing *only* on purpose and meaning is draining if you're not enjoying the journey.

The real secret to lasting happiness is to integrate both.

For example, instead of just mindlessly clicking in the Youtube sink-hole (purely hedonic), you could watch a thought-provoking documentary that sparks your curiosity (hedonic + eudaimonic).

Or, you could volunteer for a cause you care about (eudaimonic) and then celebrate your hard work with a nice dinner (hedonic).

It’s about being intentional with your pursuits, recognizing that sustainable happiness comes not from maximizing one thing, but from thoughtfully weaving both pleasure and purpose into your daily life.
