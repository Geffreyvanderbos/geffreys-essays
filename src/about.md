Notes to my younger and older self. I'm thinking through things like technology, music, and what it means to live a good life . You're welcome to read along. 

My name is Geffrey van der Bos. I am an experience designer and product owner, according to my [resume](https://linkedout.geff.re). My wife is a [brilliant illustrator](https://illustratorjulia.com) and our Loki is an fierce Shiba Inu.
