Inspired by [I Wish People Were More Public](https://borretti.me/article/i-wish-people-were-more-public), I'll be adding some [Slash Pages](https://slashpages.net/) to make this blog more personable.

## [/Blogroll](/blogroll)
Personal websites and blogs I follow and appreciate.

## [/Changelog](/changelog)
Recent changes to this website.

## [/Colophon](/colophon)
An overview on how this site was made.

<!--## /Defaults
Apps I use for various tasks.-->

## [/Now](/now)
What is going on at this point in my life.

## [/Purge](/purge)
My progress to cleaning up my digital footprint.
