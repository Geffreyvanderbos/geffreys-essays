I build this website to be as maintainable as possible.
Too often I have lost track of the development.
I can't count the times I made something too complex and lost interest.
I'm done experimenting with tired CMS and no-good frameworks that get in the way.

## Build on Plain Text and Eleventy
I took the most minimal setup I could and build on that with one rule: Every time I add something, I have to take something out; it doesn’t need to be of the same complexity—it could be a complete feature or a CSS class name.”

## No webfonts
I do not load any custom webfonts; not locally, not from one of our technology overlords.
Yes, I will lose some control over my typography.
My defaults, however, should suffice and make the site look similar on every device.

## No tracking
What would I need to track you for?
The numbers would end up in a database for me to stare at.
It's not that I will be making decisions based on them.
This is my little place on the internet.
