Hey! My name is Geffrey. I’m a designer for a non-profit. We help people in or at risk of debt find the right help. It’s eye-opening, really.

I relax by reading about music and learning about technology. Sometimes, I’ll try dissonant chords on the piano. My wife doesn’t seem to mind. The dog though, he loses his shit over a tri-tone.

When I grow up, I want to be a musicologist. And, I really like the idea of writing well. Or to expertly play an instrument. And learn proper programming! Oh, and it would help my self-confidence if I'd pack on 20 kilo of muscle.

I learned this trait is called multipotentiality. Clearly, I’m stuck at the potential bit. That’s why I’m exploring essay writing. Perhaps someday I’ll produce something noteworthy! Until then: enjoy the mediocrity.
